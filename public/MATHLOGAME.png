# MATHLOGAME.png Placeholder
# 
# This is a placeholder file for the MATHLOGAME logo.
# Replace this file with the actual MATHLOGAME.png logo image.
# 
# The logo should be:
# - PNG format
# - Approximately 120x40 pixels or similar aspect ratio
# - Transparent background preferred
# - Should match the gradient colors: #4BB3FD to #10B981
# 
# Current implementation uses the SVG version as fallback.
